            <h2>EXPECTATIONS</h2>
            <p>Since this subject is Mastery in Web Technology, I expect the course to be both challenging and informative. I expect the course to expand my existing knowledge regarding web technologies through classroom lectures, written/online activities, and especially technical activities. I hope to be able to work with my classmates if there will be collaborative activities, as well as participate in lectures done by our class instructor in a classroom with working equipment.</p>

            <h2>MOTIVATIONS</h2>
            <p>I am highly motivated to take this subject for various reasons. First and foremost, I am motivated by learning itself, especially when it comes to my chosen major. Another reason is my desire to level up my technical skills when it comes it web development. Also, I think that the things I will learn in this course will be helpful in my future career, or even our existing Capstone project. I am also motivated to finish school as a thank you to my parents who have supported my education.</p>

            <h2>CONTRIBUTIONS</h2>
            <p>From now on, I will try my best to submit requirements on time by managing my time better and maximizing it. I will also try not to be absent during face-to-face classes without a valid reason and try to attend classes on time. I will listen to the instructor during lectures and will exert the necessary effort and more in working together with classmates during group activities. Lastly, I will study for all quizzes and examinations.</p>

            <h2>HINDRANCES</h2>
            <p>One of the main problems I will face in this course is time management, which I can try to manage. We are also currently taking our Capstone 2 so there might be more demands from that subject. There are also ongoing roadworks in our area which significantly lenghtens the time I have to spend travelling to school. Familial and household obligations or events also takes up time. All of these might cause me to lose time that could be given to this course instead.</p>
